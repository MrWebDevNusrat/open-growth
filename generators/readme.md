# Generators

**Signal Generators** are the automated trigger of Open Growth functions.

In order to send our customer delights at any hour of the day, there needs to be an always on generator to indicate the precise moment a customer is ready to be delighted. Generators can be shaped from an existing web application, a simple script powered by [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), an external service that offers [Webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook), or anything in between. The generator must be able to publish to PubNub to interact with your Open Growth instance. PubNub has [70+ SDKs](https://www.pubnub.com/docs#all-sdks-home) and a [REST API](https://www.pubnub.com/http-rest-push-api/) so you can create a Generator with any internet connected device and programming language.
