# Generators

**Signal Generators** are the automated trigger of Open Growth functions.

In order to send our customer delights at any hour of the day, there needs to be an always on generator to indicate the precise moment a customer is ready to be delighted. Generators can be shaped from an existing web application, a simple script powered by [Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron), an external service that offers [Webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook), or anything in between.

The generator must be able to publish to PubNub to interact with your Open Growth instance. PubNub has [70+ SDKs](https://www.pubnub.com/docs#all-sdks-home) and a [REST API](https://www.pubnub.com/http-rest-push-api/) to easily create a Signal Generator with almost any internet connected device and programming language.

## Sign Up Generator Example

If you want to automatically delight customers the instant they sign up for your service, you can create a Sign Up Signal Generator. Open Growth provides an example python script (**signups.py**) that is meant to query a customer database for the newest sign ups.

This script should be run often using Cron or a similar service. The query selects the newest sign ups and publishes a signal (PubNub message) to your Open Growth instance, which will be processed by a [signal handler](https://github.com/pubnub/open-growth/tree/master/signals). Open Growth will then send a **[delight](https://github.com/pubnub/open-growth/tree/master/delights)** to the new customer.

## Webhook Generator Example

Another useful generator is the SendGrid [Event Webhook](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Webhooks/event.html). Whenever an email is sent from Open Growth with [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), the email activity is tracked, and updates are signaled by SendGrid. This generator can be enabled in the SendGrid admin dashboard (Settings -> Mail Settings -> Event Notification). In `open-growth/signals/sendgrid-updates.js` there is a signal handler to process activity signals that are generated by SendGrid.
