# Delights

**Delight** - A method of outreach to your customer i.e. email, text, tweet, special delivery of cake üç∞

The magic of Open Growth is encouraging engagement from a high volume of customers **automatically**. We can send personalized outreach to customers using any of the **delights** we build. Open Growth rounds up our customer's contact information and makes a decision to email, text, call, tweet, facebook post, linkedin message, and even send a slice of cake when we want, all without a human.

These delight functions are called at the end of the **[delights.js](https://github.com/pubnub/open-growth/tree/master/handlers)** Event Handler once Open Growth has prepared contact info, a request body for the REST API of the delight, and confirmed that the customer should be receiving this delight now.

Go forth and delight customers ‚ù§Ô∏è
